###Sentiment Analysis for Twitter
This project was created during a course in Artificial Intelligence at Stockholm University. The program attempts to do sentiment analysis on realtime data collected through Twitters Search API.

#####Getting Started - prerequisites for this project
This project uses Jupyter Notebook which can be accessed through your web browser using Google Colaboratory. The file can be accessed through the following link:
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1fvagVP1qkOWEegWmlXo5mRyxPAY6QHix?usp=sharing

If access to edit is not given, you could instead create a copy of the file and then try to run the new copy. The keys needed to use the Twitter API is included in the project file. If keys is not working or if you for any other reason wish to set up your own configuration you should follow the guide given by Twitter on how to gain access to their API:
https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/getting-started

Other than that, every other needed import is done by running the code cells included in the file.

####Running the code
In Jupyter Notebook separate cells is used to run the code. This is done by clicking the play-button of each cell. Adding to that, there are textcells inbetween the codecells which provides some additional information about the code that is being runned. A more complete guide on how the run Jupyter Notebook -projects in Google Colaboratory is given in this online guide:

####Contributors & Acknowledgments
The implementation of the Sentiment Analysis in this project is mostly done upon the ideas and the code that is presented in this online tutorial done by Shaumik Daityari:
