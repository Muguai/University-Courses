### Tanks
This project was created during a course in Artificial Intelligence at Stockholm University. The program attempts to solve problems in a 2D tank game with the help of AI related solutions.

#### Getting Started - prerequisites for this project
This project uses the 4.0 alpha 1 version of Processing which can be downloaded through following link:
https://processing.org/download/
The 4.0 alpha 1 version of Processing is necessary to get the lambda expressions in the project to function properly.
The project is implemented to work directly in the Processing IDE and correct functionality in any other IDE 
could not be guaranteed. In addition to the standard Processing library you will also need to import the independent
sound library called Minim. This could easily be done through your Processing IDE if you click Sketch -> Import Library -> Add Library in your top left tab window. From there you could find your way to installing the Minim file.

#### Running the tests
Once you followed the guide given above you should be able to run the code using the start button
in the Processing IDE.

Every agent must have a GeneralProblem and a problem formulation. A problem is formulated by calling the GeneralProblem constructor 
and passing defined functions as arguments. In the code the problem formulation is done inside the method formulateGoal(). For more information refer to the GeneralProblem class.
An agent must also have one instance of the Search class to be able to call the different search algorithms.
Tank4 uses A* but the algorithm can be substituted for any offline search algorithm in Search by changing the method call in updateLogic.
Tank5 uses LRTA* and should not be changed.

Several of the functions for different problems are scattered around files Team2 and utility_functions.
If confused, right click the function name and "Jump to declaration".

#### Contributors & Acknowledgments
The implementation of this project is mostly done upon ideas presented in Stuart Russell’s and Peter Norvig’s book 
”Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach”, where pseudocode has been used for the implementation of algorithms.
